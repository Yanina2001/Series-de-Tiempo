### Students

Please, write here the names of the involved people in this development. **Important**: Only the students listed here will be considered for evaluation with this repository.

- Sainz Takata Juan Pablo Minoru
- Medina Barreras Daniel Ivan
- Ramirez Mendez Kevin
- De Luna Ocampo Yanina

### Instructions

Implement the functions in the file _exam_2.py_. The description of each function is documented in the same file.

#### Notes

- All functions that receive a time serie are expected to consider that it will be received as $[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]$

- Wherever you compute the covariances is expected to be computed unbiased.

- Only the included packages in the template and the standard python packages are allowed.

- If you have any doubt about the expected output for any function, you can take a look in the _exam_2_tests.py_ file.

### Tests

Additionally, a file named _exam_2_test.py_ is attached, the idea is that you can test locally your implementations using that file, to run it you need to install the _pytest_ package and then simply execute: 

    pytest

The real tests will be pretty similar, but using another data. Try to pass as much tests as possible before the deadline.

Finally, if you have any doubt don't hessitate to contact me.

Good luck! :)
